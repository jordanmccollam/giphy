# Fail Gif Generator / GIPHY

## Overview
This is an app that allows the user to select one of the pre-existing topics shown on the website or create a new topic of their choosing. The app will then generate a few gifs based on the selected topic and display them to the user.

## Motivation / Purpose
First and foremost, this is an app that is fun and might give the user a few laughs. But along with that, the purpose of this project was to showcase my ability to incooperate API's and manipulate them through user input.
